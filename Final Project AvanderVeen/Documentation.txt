Script: citibike.py
Current Date: December 8th, 2014

This script takes Citibike data as input. It converts the Citibike data to
a valid geodatabase and runs a statistical analysis on the data using
matplotlib. The analysis outputs three histogram images with the mean
and standard deviation embedded in the image. 

Contents of this zipped folder:
- Example Data for February of this year
- Original citibike.py source code
- ArcPy Toolbox (citibike.tbx)

Make sure to unzip the folder. Please do not move the script in the folder
to a different location. To use this script tool, add the toolbox to 
ArcToolbox, open the toolbox and launch the script tool. 

If the script source cannot be found by the script tool in ArcGIS, 
please right-click on the script tool in ArcToolbox, go to Properties, 
and correct the source path in the Source tab of the Properties.

Required Modules / Packages:
- ArcPy
- Datetime
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

The script tool requires the following inputs:
- Citibike data (e.g. 2014-02 - Citi Bike trip data.csv)
- Day of the Month (e.g. '19' for 19th of February) 

Data from February is included as an example, but the script can
load and analyze all recen Citibike data from the site:
http://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data

It will take around 30 seconds to complete. During the running 
of the script, it should display how many trips it has processed
and at what point of the day the script is. 

After running, it should add the following files to the folder:
- Geodatabase (Output.gdb)
- Layer file (Citibike.lyr)
- StatisticsGender.png
- StatisticsLength.png
- StatisticsTrip.png

For documentation on the individual steps, please read the 
inline documentation.
